You can now add a parameter `dev_tags` which is very similar to the `tags` parameter that already exists.

If this parameter is set, these additional tags are also created when building the Docker images.

Downstream processes treat "dev tags" specially: they are pushed automatically when they reach the "stable" channel, meaning all tests have passed and they are signed and scanned. This allows continuous updating of public images on DockerHub for development purposes. For production purposes, the other `tags` are the ones to use. Those ones are only pushed when an official product release is made.
