# Changelog - Docker Build Action

## Unreleased Changes (targeting v1.3.2)

Internal:
  - Added dev/ machinery from actions-go-build.

## [v1.3.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/actions-docker-build/releases/tag/v1.3.1) - June 13, 2022

Handles enterprise version correctly: if there's already version metadata supplied, it is used as-is rather than appending another `+ent` to the end.

## [v1.2.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/actions-docker-build/releases/tag/v1.2.1) - March 08, 2022

- [Fix for `REPO_NAME` not being set when calling the workflow from a schedule.](https://github.com/hashicorp/actions-docker-build/pull/18)

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/actions-docker-build/releases/tag/v1.2.0) - June 13, 2022

- Fixing issue with docker buildx targeting arm cpus from amd64 host
- Add capability to run docker images smoke test in CI 

## [v1.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/actions-docker-build/releases/tag/v1.1) - January 04, 2022

You can now add a parameter `dev_tags` which is very similar to the `tags` parameter that already exists.

If this parameter is set, these additional tags are also created when building the Docker images.

Downstream processes treat "dev tags" specially: they are pushed automatically when they reach the "stable" channel, meaning all tests have passed and they are signed and scanned. This allows continuous updating of public images on DockerHub for development purposes. For production purposes, the other `tags` are the ones to use. Those ones are only pushed when an official product release is made.

Internal: See RELTOOL-52 for full details of this and related changes.

## [v1.0.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/actions-docker-build/releases/tag/v1.0.1) - October 12, 2021

Fixing AUTO_TAG to include VERSION and match TARBALL_NAME.
