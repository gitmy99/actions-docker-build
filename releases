{"body":"You can now add a parameter `dev_tags` which is very similar to the `tags` parameter that already exists.\r\n\r\nIf this parameter is set, these additional tags are also created when building the Docker images.\r\n\r\nDownstream processes treat \"dev tags\" specially: they are pushed automatically when they reach the \"stable\" channel, meaning all tests have passed and they are signed and scanned. This allows continuous updating of public images on DockerHub for development purposes. For production purposes, the other `tags` are the ones to use. Those ones are only pushed when an official product release is made.\r\n\r\nInternal: See RELTOOL-52 for full details of this and related changes.","name":"v1.1","tagName":"v1.1"}
